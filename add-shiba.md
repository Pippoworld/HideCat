# Add Shiba Inu Enemy

The user has provided a sprite sheet with 4 frames of a cute Shiba Inu dog running animation.
The sprite has a black and tan color scheme typical of Shiba Inus.

Need to:
1. Save the sprite image as shiba-sprite.png
2. Create a ShibaInu enemy class
3. Add spawn logic for Shiba enemies
4. Make Shiba behavior different from wild dogs (maybe friendlier but still an obstacle)
